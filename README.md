I've completed the task and developed modules in data_import.py, common.py, sentiment_engine.py, and the main.py driver script. I've implemented basic text mining to clean the text and split it into sentences. I've utilized sentiment analysis for each of these sentences using both VADER Compound scores within the range of [-1, 1] and TextBlob's Polarity within the range of [-1, 1], along with Subjectivity in the range of [0, 1]. An example of the results is shown in the image below.I used the following libraries for this task:vaderSentimentPyMuPDFrequestsbeautifulsoup4To support text mining, I used the following resources:nltk.download('punkt')nltk.download('stopwords')In order to execute the main.py, kindly replace it with your actual email address and generate a temporary password as below: Enable the IMAP Access at: Gmail Settings> Forwarding and POP / IMAP> IMAP AcessEnable 2-factor authentication for the google accountthen generate an app-specific password (https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)Use this newly generated password for imap login
